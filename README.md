## Projects
### Customer Targeting with Machine Learning
[Project detail](https://github.com/oakpongphon/Targeting_messages_usingML)

Utilized machine learning techniques to optimize customer targeting in marketing campaigns. Implemented **logistic regression**, **neural networks**, and **random forests** to improve profitability and Return on Marketing Expenditure (ROME) for high-end steakhouse and mobile app promotions.

### Shared Social Responsibility: A Field Experiment in Pay-What-You-Want Pricing and Charitable Giving
[Project detail]()

Evaluated the effectiveness of various pricing strategies, including flat-rate pricing (FR), flat-rate pricing with 50% of revenue donated to charity (FR charity), Name Your Own Price (NYOP), and Name Your Own Price with 50% of revenue to charity (NYOP charity). Utilizing **Python**, I conducted *hypothesis testing*, *means comparison*, *data manipulation*, and *visualizations* to assess the outcomes.

### ETL with Snowflake, SQL Project
[Project detail](https://github.com/oakpongphon/sql_proj)

Extract, transform and load data from 4 different formats: csv, XML, postgres and Snowflake Marketplace deploying **Python** including **SQL** codes embedded inside to execute.

### Regress Analysis the Case of the Hot Hand
[Project detail](https://github.com/oakpongphon/Regression_Analysis/tree/main/Case_NBA)

This project delves into the fascinating concept of the 'hot hand' in basketball, a phenomenon where players are perceived to have periods of exceptional performance. Using a mix of regression analysis and hypothesis testing, the project offers insights into whether the 'hot hand' phenomenon can be statistically validated in professional basketball.

### Optimization of Quant Croissant Production at Rady Tasty Pastry
[Project detail](https://github.com/oakpongphon/BusOperation_RadytastePastry)

Developed a simulation model using **Python** to identify the optimal production quantity (q) that maximizes profitability while mitigating the risk of surplus or shortage fo Rady Tasty Pastry facing a recurring dilemma concerning the production of their popular Quant Croissants â€“ an imbalance between daily production and customer demand. 

### Regression Coursework1: Linear, classification and Recommendation
[Project detail](https://github.com/oakpongphon/Regression_Analysis/tree/main/Regression_Coursework1)

This courework provides a high-level view of the various analytical techniques and models that I explored in this coursework, spanning regression, classification, and recommendation systems, with a specific focus on the gaming domain.

### Regression Coursework2: Lasso
[Project detail](https://github.com/oakpongphon/Regression_Analysis/tree/main/Regression_Coursework2)

In this coursework, I engaged in an in-depth exploration of Lasso regression, a powerful technique in linear regression analysis used for variable selection and regularization.
